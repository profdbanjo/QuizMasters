# Project Goal

Over time, there has been an increase in the number of students requesting course waivers at CISAT.

CISAT has mandated the course facilitators to produce a Quiz app to serve as an evaluation for the waiver. If the student passes the quiz, they are eligible for a waiver.

So, the experiment will begin with the IST303 course, and therefore, Professor Wallace has contracted this project to Quiz Masters to develop an app to suit this purpose.

In the stakeholder's deliberation, they realized the quiz app could also serve as an assessment for students enrolled in the IST303 class.

If this experiment succeeds, CISAT will replicate the quiz app for all other courses offered in CISAT.


# Stakeholders

**Course Facilitator**

Professor Wallace is the project sponsor, and he has contracted the IST303 quiz app development to Quiz Masters to fulfill one of CISAT’s requirements for assessing how much understanding the student have in software development. This app would serve as an evaluation for those seeking to waive the IST303 class and an assessment tool for enrolled students.

**Center for Information Systems and Technology (CISAT)**

Our client operates under the directives of CISAT, making CISAT the investor in the IST303 quiz development. Should the quiz app become successful, CISAT intends to replicate this development in other core courses offered in the department.

**Students (End Users)**

Students from the IST303 class and others considering a course waiver will be the end-users who will rely on the app as an assessment and evaluation tool. They will take and complete the quizzes and perform other tasks that Professor Wallace requires. In addition, IST 303 students can seek help from the quizmaster’s help desk when there are issues or confusion.

**Program Coordinator (Secondary Users)**

These stakeholders fall under secondary users as they will be interacting with the products created by the software. Quiz Masters will ensure the IST303 quiz app produces outputs that fit into the workflow of the secondary users. Secondary users could generate reports from the app.

**Team members**

The team members include the product owner, scrum master, and developers.

While it is essential to have a product owner take accountability for the project, so will the scrum master ensure that the agile methodology adheres through collaboration and transparency. Finally, the developers will write the codes and build app interfaces.
